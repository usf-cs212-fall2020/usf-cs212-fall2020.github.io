For this project, you will extend your [previous project](project-4a.html) to include a [search engine web interface](project-4b.html) using [embedded Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) and servlets to search that index.

**This writeup is for the search engine functionality only.** See the general [Project 4 Writeup](project-4.html) for more details.

## Functionality

The core functionality of your project must satisfy the following requirements:

  - Maintain the functionality of the [previous project](project-3.html).

  - Process additional command-line parameters to support the functionality of this project. See the [Input](#input) section for specifics.

  - Support the same output capability as before. See the [Output](#output) section for specifics.

  - Pending

The functionality of your project will be evaluated with various JUnit tests. Please see the [Testing](#testing) section for specifics.

## Input

Your main method must be placed in a class named `Driver`. The `Driver` class should accept the following **additional** command-line arguments:

  - Pending

The command-line flag/value pairs may be provided in any order, and the order provided is not the same as the order you should perform the operations (i.e. always build the index before performing search, even if the flags are provided in the other order).

Your code should support all of the command-line arguments from the [previous project](project-3.html) as well.

## Output

## Testing

## Hints

It is important to develop the project iteratively. One possible breakdown of tasks are:

  - Pending

The important part will be to test your code as you go. The JUnit tests provided only test the entire project as a whole, not the individual parts. You are responsible for testing the individual parts themselves.
